# pythonbot

Python bot does many things! 
Firstly, any time someone types an integer, it creates a pyramid with the height of that integer!
Ex.
4
   *
  * *
 * * *
* * * *

Secondly, it responds to specific word phrases:
Marquez -> "\* Marcus"
Thomas -> "You mean the choo-choo guy?"
economy -> "is useless"
And you and I -> text in the .env file

Thirdly, if someone says a swear word, the bot responds "no u" 

Fourthly, if the user in the .env file says "tall" it responds "short."
